There once was a hund who lived in Berlin.
He left his schloss in search of bratwurst.
His search lead him to a biergarten.
A girl wearing a dirndel offered him gaebaek.
The hund said, "No thank you, if I wanted brot I'd go to the baeckerei."
He continued his search down the hauptstrasse in search of bratwurst.
A man pulled up in a porsche and asked "where are you headed". 
The hund replied "to the Flughafen, I've got a flight to catch."
